# Exam Practice Resources

## Killercoda
https://killercoda.com/killer-shell-ckad

Provides playground environment and scenarios for getting used to the exam environment with tasks. I also used the playground to do exercises that I found elsewhere.

It is worth noting how well designed it is, with a lot of understanding of the actual exam and the questions a user may be asking. It is very up to date. It also provides a lot of direction and feedback during the scenarios to assist a learner.

## Killer.sh
https://killer.sh/

Exam simulator to prepare students for the real exam. Made to look and feel like the real thing, with exam-level-difficulty questions. With the purchase of the exam, you get two sessions in killer.sh. Each session is 2 hours to actually take the practice exam, 36 hours of environment access, and unlimited access to the solutions.

This resource is probably the best way to guage if you're ready for the real exam. I found the questions to be more difficult than the real exam - more wide randing in topics, more subtasks, more manual creation of resources.

My tips for using killer.sh:

- Take your first session after studying and learning the material, take note of what you got wrong, how fast you were able to complete questions.
- Learn the correct keystrokes and idosyncracies of the exam environment, etc. Return to and improve on those topics, tools, and skills for a while
- Return to take the second practice exam a few days before the real exam
- Use the provided solutions and explanations to understand the best ways to complete questions.

## KodeKloud Udemy Course and Exercises
https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-application-developer/

A course and accompanying exercises to guide a learner through Kubernetes concepts and exam expectations. It does a great job of explaining most of the core content. Usually regarded as one of the best courses on the subject, but...

At the time of writing, the course is still useful but is a bit out of date. It was originally created in 2019, and a section for 2021 test updates was added, but no content has been integrated or updated since.

## Various Exercises
There are too many resources that provide exercises, and this is clearly not a complete list. But, these are some of the resources I used to practice.

## Simulated Exam Environment
https://killercoda.com/kimwuestkamp/scenario/cks-cka-ckad-remote-desktop

This simulated environment mimics PSI's remote desktop where you will be taking the real exam. It is likely more clunky than what you're used so, so it is definitely useful to practice in this envrionment. Specifically practice keystrokes and searching K8s documentation in the browser.

This was created by the same people as killer.sh, but has unlimited access (no questions, though).

## Linux Foundation Kubernetes for Developers (LFD259) Course
https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/kubernetes-for-developers/

I am only sharing this here to warn others against purchasing this course. I felt that the official LF course that can be bundled with the exam would be great and cover exactly what the exam would be. I was very wrong.

This course is not geared toward the CKAD in particular. It is a wide ranging brain dump of Kubernetes history, concepts, and uses. The labs are given as a PDF and do not reflect what you'd be doing in the CKAD. This course *could* be useful for someone learning more about Kubernetes in general, but there are free and better options available.
